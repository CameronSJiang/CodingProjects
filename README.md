*Java Programming Project*

[View the Java Source Code](./Main.java)

## 💡 Overview
A console-based Java application designed to manage personal finances by tracking income and expenses. This project demonstrates core Java concepts including Object-Oriented Programming, List management, and user input validation.

## 🛠️ Technical Features
- **Data Management:** Utilizes `ArrayList` to store and retrieve transaction history dynamically.
- **Scanner Logic:** Handles real-time user input for financial values and dates.
- **Logic Handling:** Implements conditional checks to ensure expenses do not exceed the current balance.

## 🏗️ Engineering Logic
In this project, I focused on **data integrity**. I ensured that every transaction is timestamped and categorized, simulating the basic logic used in professional financial software.

## 📌 Project Purpose
This project was intended to help me learn how to utilize basic arithmetic and data management systems for real-world functionality
